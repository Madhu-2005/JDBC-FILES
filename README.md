2. UI Structure / API Schema Design
UI Structure (3 Pages)
	Page 1 – Movie Selection
Movie dropdown or cards with posters.
	Date & showtime selection.
	“Next” button to proceed.
	Page 2 – Seat Selection & Form
o	Seat map with clickable seats.
o	Form fields:
▪	Name, Email, Phone Number
▪	Ticket Count
▪	Payment Option (Card/UPI/Wallet)
o	Real-time validation:
▪	Required fields
▪	Valid email/phone
▪	Seat availability
o	“Next/Submit” button
	Page 3 – Confirmation
	Display booked tickets and user details.
	“Download/Print Ticket” button.
	Option to book again or exit.
API Schema Design
Endpoint	Method	Input	Output	Description
/api/movies	GET	None	JSON of movies & showtimes	Fetch available movies.
/api/seats	GET	movieId, showtime	JSON seat map	Get current seat availability.
/api/book	POST	userDetails, movieId, showtime, seats	JSON {success, bookingId}	Book tickets and store in database.
/api/validate	POST	Form input	JSON {valid: true/false, errors}	Server-side form validation.
3. Data Handling Approach
1.	Frontend Handling
o	Form fields validated in real-time (JS events: onchange, onsubmit).
o	Seat selection updates state dynamically (selected vs. available seats).
o	Local storage/session storage can be used for temporary data.
2.	Backend Handling
o	Input sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
o	Seat availability checked before booking to avoid double booking.
o	Successful booking stored in database with a unique booking ID.
3.	Error Handling
o	Client-side alerts for invalid input.
2. Core Features Implementation
1.	Movie Selection Page
o	Fetch movies using API.
o	Display movie posters, showtimes, and date picker.
o	Button to proceed to seat selection.
2.	Seat Selection & Form Page
o	Interactive seat map with click-to-select functionality.
o	Form fields with real-time validation:
	Name, Email, Phone Number, Ticket Count.
o	Validation rules:
	Required fields must be filled.
	Email format valid.
	Phone number numeric & length check.
o	Seat availability checked before selection.
3.	Confirmation Page
o	Display booked tickets with user details.
o	Option to download or print ticket.
4.	API Integration
o	GET /movies – Fetch available movies.
o	GET /seats – Fetch seat availability.
o	POST /book – Submit booking after validation.

3. Data Storage (Local State / Database)
1.	Frontend Local State
o	Store selected movie, showtime, and seats temporarily in:
	JavaScript variables or objects.
	Optional: localStorage or sessionStorage for temporary persistence.
2.	Backend Database
o	Store user booking and ticket details in MongoDB:
o	{
o	  "name": "John Doe",
o	  "email": "john@example.com",
o	  "phone": "9876543210",
o	  "movieId": "MOV123",
o	  "showtime": "7:00 PM",
o	  "seats": ["A1", "A2"]
o	}
o	Ensure seat availability is updated after each booking.
4. Testing Core Features
1.	Frontend Testing
o	Check interactive seat selection.
o	Validate form fields for correct input.
o	Ensure navigation between pages works.
2.	Backend Testing
Test API endpoints using Postman:
   movies returns correct movie list.
seats returns seat availability.
book correctly stores booking and handles errors.
o	Handle edge cases: duplicate booking, invalid data, empty fields.
3.	Integration Testing
o	Simulate a full booking:
	Select movie → choose seats → submit form → verify database entry → confirm ticket display.
1. Final Demo Walkthrough
The Smart Movie Ticket Interactive Form Validation project is a front-end web application designed to make ticket booking easy, fast, and accurate. It allows users to browse available movies, select a showtime, and book tickets using an interactive form that validates user input in real time.
Demo Highlights:
•	Landing Page: A simple, user-friendly homepage listing movies, timings, and prices.
•	Booking Form: Interactive fields for Name, Email, Phone Number, and Seat Selection.
•	Validation Logic: Fields are validated dynamically, with instant error messages for incorrect or blank entries.
•	Error Handling: Users receive clear error prompts such as “Invalid email format” or “Phone number must have 10 digits.”
•	Mobile Compatibility: Fully responsive design for smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
•	Confirmation Page: Displays a booking summary and a unique confirmation code for user records.
The final demo showcases a smooth, step-by-step ticket booking experience that prevents common user mistakes, improves usability, and ensures a professional presentation.

2. Detailed Project Report
The main goal of this project is to simplify online ticket booking while ensuring data accuracy and error-free submissions. Unlike static booking forms, this system uses client-side JavaScript validation to minimize incorrect submissions and improve user experience.
Objectives:
1.	Provide a fast and easy ticket booking solution.
2.	Implement strong form validation to reduce data entry errors.
3.	Ensure a clean, minimal, and responsive design.
4.	Develop a codebase that is easy to maintain and extend.
Technology Stack:
•	HTML5: Used for semantic structure, forms, and page layout.
•	CSS3: Provides a visually appealing design with responsive layouts using Flexbox and Grid.
•	JavaScript: Handles client-side validation, dynamic interaction, and error messages.
This project is primarily front-end focused, but the structure allows future API integration for real-time movie listings and ticket availability.


o	Server-side response for validation errors or seat conflicts.
